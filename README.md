# Computing Supplementary
Computing Supplementaries made by myself  

## Python Programming
This is originally made for Introduction to Programming, CS101, KAIST. However, this covers the very basic grammar questions before list in Python. This would be useful to start Python Programming.

## Assembly Programming
This is originally made for Assembly Supplementary for Programming Structure for Electrical Engineering, EE209, KAIST. This covers basic grammars, applications, and some examples for Intel Architecture 32bit Assembly Language.

## Algorithms
This is Sample Problems to study Algorithms. There is no answer for questions, and there can be concept problem also.
